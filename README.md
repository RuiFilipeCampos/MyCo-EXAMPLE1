# An example on how to use MyCo.

This project has two branches:

- before_simulation 
- after_simulation

So that you can compare how the files look before and after simulating. The default is `after_simulation` so that you get quick results when cloning from the repo and run the code. The first run of `before_simulation` will take a while since it will compile the material data and render the geometry. After that it will look like the `after_simulation` branch.
