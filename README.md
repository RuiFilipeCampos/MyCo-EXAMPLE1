# An example on how to use MyCo.

This project has two branches:

- [before_simulation](https://github.com/RuiFilipeCampos/MyCo-EXAMPLE1/tree/before_simulation) 
- [after_simulation](https://github.com/RuiFilipeCampos/MyCo-EXAMPLE1/tree/after_simulation) **

So that you can compare how the files look before and after the first simulation. The default is `after_simulation` so that you get quick results when cloning from the repo and run the code. The first run of `before_simulation` will take a while since it will compile the material data and render the geometry. After that it will look like the `after_simulation` branch.
